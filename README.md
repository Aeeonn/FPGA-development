# FPGA Development

This repository contains my FPGA development projects. These projects are primarily for learning and experimentation as I explore FPGA design and development.

## About

I recently started working with FPGAs and created this repository to track my progress and maintain version control. My focus is on understanding the fundamentals of FPGA programming, digital logic design, and hardware description languages.

## Tools & Hardware

- **FPGA Board:** Terasic DE10-Lite (Intel Altera architecture)
- **Development Software:** Intel Quartus
- **Programming Languages:** Verilog/VHDL (currently exploring)

## Project Structure

This repository will be updated with various projects as I learn more. Each project may include:

- HDL source code (Verilog/VHDL)
- Project documentation and notes
- Simulation and testing files

## Future Plans

As I gain more experience, I plan to explore more complex FPGA applications and document key learnings along the way.
